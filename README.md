I’m @duncan-mackay, founder and director of PlusPlus Consulting (UK), and founder of the puttr.uk project.
My interests include science and tech, freedom and free-speech, and empowering individuals to do more.
Unfortunately, I have been forced to requesting the striking-off of PlusPlus Consulting, as it is insolvent,
having been unable to land any contract this year.
My attention is therfore solely on the puttr.uk project now.

I’m looking for collaborators on the puttr project - webdevs, publicists, journos.

There is now a stub page, describing the project at https://puttr.uk
