I’m @duncan-mackay, founder and director of PlusPlus Consulting (UK), and founder of the puttr.uk project.
My interests include science and tech, freedom and free-speech, and empowering individuals to do more.
I’m currently learning all about stackblitz, evaluating it as a potential environment for developing puttr.

I’m looking for collaborators on the puttr project - webdevs, publicists, journos.

You can find me on https://linkedin.com/in/strangesheep - at least for now ;)
You can email me directly at duncan@puttr.uk
