I’m @duncan-mackay, founder of the puttr.uk project.
My interests include science and tech, freedom and free-speech, and empowering individuals to do more.
Unfortunately, I have recently been forced to close PlusPlus Consulting. It is insolvent.

Consequently, my attention is therefore solely on the puttr.uk project now.

I’m looking for collaborators on the puttr project - webdevs, publicists, journos.

There is now a stub page, describing the project and the ideas taking shape at https://puttr.uk
